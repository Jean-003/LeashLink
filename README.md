## Description
This project is creating a website for people to find local family and pet friendly events. With future functionality to create and integrate local walking group events and place them into a shared planner using a google maps API and Ticketmaster Event API. This website utilises HTML, Bootstrap, CSS styling and Javascript to create a coherent and dynamic structure on the webpage.

The motivation to build this project is to help gain a better understanding of how to access and utilise third party APIs and to practice creating and styling web pages as part of a dev team. 

### This project has allowed the following learning outcomes:
- How to create different sections of content on the website using html and css styling.
- How to use Bootstrap efficiently.
- How to 'fetch' APIs and utilise the data'.
- How to create local storage.
- Creating a website with additional page.
- how to combine different APIs and manipulate and integrate the information and append to the web page.
