# Leash Link
## Description
Leash Link is a web application designed to help users discover local family and pet-friendly events. The project's future functionality aims to integrate local walking group events seamlessly into a shared planner using Google Maps API and Ticketmaster Event API.

### Key Learning Outcomes:
Creating different sections of content on the website using HTML and CSS styling.
Efficient usage of Bootstrap framework.
Fetching data from APIs and utilizing it effectively.
Implementation of local storage.
Creating a multi-page website.
Integrating and manipulating information from different APIs and appending it to the webpage.
